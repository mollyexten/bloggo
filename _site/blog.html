      <p>North Woods, by Daniel Mason, follows stories from a specific spot in Western Massachusetts. Mason takes the reader to this spot with a pair of lovers escaping a Puritan society and continues to narrate events and details throughout the centuries. While the human plotlines are the easiest to follow, the story of the natural world maintains a constant presence, and I really appreciate how Mason frames the relationship between humans and their natural world.</p>
