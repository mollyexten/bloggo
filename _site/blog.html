      <p>North Woods, by Daniel Mason, follows the stories of humans, animals, and nature in a specific spot in Western Massachusetts. While the human plotlines are the easiest to follow, the story of the natural world maintains a constant presence, at times in the background of human events, at other times as the main focus. I really appreciate how Mason frames the relationship between humans and their natural world.</p>
