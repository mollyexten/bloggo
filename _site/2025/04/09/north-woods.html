    <h1>North Woods</h1>
<p>April  9, 2025</p>

<p>In <em>North Woods</em>, Daniel Mason describes how different characters live their lives in a specific spot in western Massachusetts. Mason takes the reader to this spot with a pair of lovers escaping a Puritan society and continues to narrate events that take place in this same spot throughout the centuries. A home is built in this spot, and it’s eventually known as the yellow house. People come to the yellow house seeking a new life or escaping an old one.  There is a lot that piqued my curiosity in this book - interesting characters living on the margins of society, learning about mental health treatments from the past. But what really stood out to me was the way Mason frames the relationship between humans and their natural world.</p>

<p>Mason’s writing calls attention to seemingly subtle moments in the natural world that are no less powerful: the growth of an apple seed from a buried man’s stomach, the unintentional transplanting of old world seeds to new world soil, the journey of a single spore that destroys a chestnut forest. I loved this about <em>North Woods</em>. Recognizing the agency of nature is like realizing there’s another dimension that’s been in front of you all along. This reminds me a lot of what Jenny Odell describes in <em>How to Do Nothing</em> – of becoming more aware of your natural surroundings to foster (or rekindle?) a sense of belonging. It brings comfort.</p>

<p>At the same time, appreciating the nature can also induce a feeling of grief over what’s lost. When I read about the changes in the land around the yellow house, it was hard not to feel grief for the loss: native plants overtaken by invasive species, disease and blight killing elm, chestnut, and ash trees. Yet, as one of the modern-day characters reasons, loss is one part of the story. The natural world is always changing in a series of cascading events. Nature abhors a vacuum, and new plants take over. Perhaps, as a way to manage my climate anxiety, I can substitute some of my sadness with a curiosity for all the changes unfolding in front of me.</p>

<p>On the topic of appreciation and curiosity for the natural world, consider the marvel that is this tiny plant growing out of a rusty fence stump near my house.</p>
