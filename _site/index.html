      <p>In <em>North Woods</em>, Daniel Mason describes how different characters live their lives in a specific spot in western Massachusetts. Mason takes the reader to this spot with a pair of lovers escaping a Puritan society and continues to narrate events that take place in this same spot throughout the centuries. A home is built in this spot, and itâ€™s eventually known as the yellow house. People come to the yellow house seeking a new life or escaping an old one.  There is a lot that piqued my curiosity in this book - interesting characters living on the margins of society, learning about mental health treatments from the past. But what really stood out to me was the way Mason frames the relationship between humans and their natural world.</p>
