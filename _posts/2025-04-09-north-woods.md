North Woods, by Daniel Mason, follows stories from a specific spot in Western Massachusetts. Mason takes the reader to this spot with a pair of lovers escaping a Puritan society and continues to narrate events and details throughout the centuries. While the human plotlines are the easiest to follow, the story of the natural world maintains a constant presence, and I really appreciate how Mason frames the relationship between humans and their natural world.

Mason's writing calls attention to seemingly subtle moments in the natural world that are no less powerful: the growth of an apple seed from a buried man's stomach, the unintentional transplanting of Old World seeds to New World soil, the journey of a single spore that destroys a Chestnut forest. These descriptions have provoked me to reflect on my own relationships with plants, especially since many of them are re-emerging after a winter of dormancy.

My daughters and I pass this Juniper bush every time we walk to the Y. They always pluck off a "berry" and squish it between their fingers to get the scent. The last time we walked past it, they asked me why the "berries" were gone, and it made me realize how important that moment is in their routine.

Last year I foolishly planted zinnias on my balcony that gets, maybe, 2 hours of sunlight. This year, I'm making peace with my environs and growing this shade-loving astilbe instead.
