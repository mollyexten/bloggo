North Woods, by Daniel Mason, follows the stories of humans, animals, and nature in a specific spot in Western Massachusetts. While the human plotlines are the easiest to follow, the story of the natural world maintains a constant presence, at times in the background of human events, at other times as the main focus.

I really appreciate how Mason frames the relationship between humans and their natural world. Sometimes novels that take place in the early colonial and early American period overlook the agency of nature, portraying it as a static landscape that humans inevitably ruin. I don't disagree that humans mess things up. But I think that "nature is fragile, don't mess it up" underestimates what the natural world is capable of.

Nature is an agent all of its own. It's easy to recognize this when catastrophic events occur, but it's powerful to realize this in subtler moments. Outside right now the transformation is swift. Plant life is peeking out of the ground after a long winter of dormancy. There's something really comforting about focusing on a natural place.
