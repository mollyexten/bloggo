North Woods, by Daniel Mason, follows the stories of humans, animals, and nature in a specific spot in Western Massachusetts. While the human plotlines are the easiest to follow, the story of the natural world maintains a constant presence, at times in the background of human events, at other times as the main focus. I really appreciate how Mason frames the relationship between humans and their natural world.

It's easy to recognize nature's agency when catastrophic natural disasters occur. It's also easy to consider our relationship to nature as dominating, when in truth it's destructive. Mason's writing calls attention to seemingly subtler moments in the natural world that are no less powerful: the growth of an apple seed from a buried man's stomach, the unintentional transplanting of Old World seeds to New World soil. My request to you, Dear Reader, is to take a moment to stare at a piece of land for a moment. It doesn't have to be beautiful. In fact, you might get more out of this activity if it's an ugly piece of land. Think about what this land might have looked like in the past. Think about what it might look like in the future. It will still be here when you are gone. Let those feelings sit with you, then go back to your day.
